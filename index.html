          <h2>I'm Tej Seth</h2>
          <br>
          <p>I am originally from Rochester Hills, Michigan and am currently a Junior at the University of Michigan 
            majoring in Information Analysis and minoring in Applied Statistics.

          <br>
          <p>
            I enjoy working on data-related projects through R, Python and SQL. This 
            includes sports analytics topics that I have worked on as part of the Michigan
            Football Analytics Society as well as on my own. On top of that, I also have 
            consulting projects. All of which can be found by clicking below!

            This past summer, I interned at Pro Football Focus (PFF) working on a various projects
            such as building a dashboard to help PFF's clients with incorporating data into 
            their recruiting, creating new statistics like WAR-Adjusted Injuries Lost and 
            Accuracy Rate Over Expected and was cited by national news publications like The Athletic 
            and ESPN

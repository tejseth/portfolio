      We sought to incorporate tracking data from weeks 1-6 of the 2017 NFL season to predict whether the next play would be a run or a pass using machine learning. 
      We also updated the play type predictions for every tenth of a second until 2.5 seconds after the snap.

      If the video tutorials don't work, I also have R coding tutorials on my github! These will be
      less nuanced than the video tutorials but still could be helpful as a lot of my public projects will be
      on there.

      I joined the efforts of Saiem Gilani, Akshay Easwaran, Jared Lee and Eric Hess 
      in providing the community an R package where they can access college football
      play-by-play data. By typing install.packages("cfbfastR") into R they can install
      the package and load in the data.
